# Chatty Bot welcomes you
## Description
Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming.

## Objective
For the first stage, you will write a bot who displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation. First impressions count!

Your program should print the following lines:

Hello! My name is {bot_name}.
I was created in {birth_year}.
Instead of {bot_name}, print any name you choose and replace {birth_year} with the current year (four digits).

## Example
Output:

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2022.
